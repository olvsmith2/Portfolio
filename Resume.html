								<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>
										<em>2021-2025, MENG MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL</em><br>
										Year two average: 78%<br>
										Highlights include 93% in Engineering Maths, 87% in Signals and Systems, 82% in Thermo-fluids, 77% in Dynamics and Control, and 75% in Electrical Energy Conversion and Supply. My course has also taught me Simulink/Simscape modelling (to build an SMPS), using FEA software (to model an actuator), Fusion 360, and electronics lab skills.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>2021, A-LEVEL, THE WILLINK SCHOOL</em><br>
											All A*: A-levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer Science.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
											<em>2019 GCSE, THE WILLINK SCHOOL</em><br>
											All grade 9s: GCSEs in Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Geography, English Language, English Literature, French and Religious Education. <br>
									</p>
								<h2>Experience</h2>
									<p>
										<em>SUMMER 2023, ELECTRICAL, CONTROL AND INSTRUMENTATION INTERN, FRAZER-NASH CONSULTANCY</em><br>
										I spent 13 weeks working in the Bristol EC&I North team at Frazer-Nash. Over this time, I worked on a variety of projects which involved PowerFactory modelling to look at the grid impact of a nuclear power station, researching and building electrical and thermal models using Simscape, designing the electrical schematic for a high voltage test rig, drawing single line diagrams for a nuclear power station, writing supporting design documentation for a nuclear power station, and evaluating different PLC options.
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>SUMMER 2021 AND 2022, RF ENGINEERING INTERN, SPIRIT SEMICONDUCTOR </em><br>
										I have completed two 9-week summer internships at Spirit Semiconductor, a start-up designing RF electronics for 5G. In my initial internship at Spirit Semiconductor, I designed a PCB that facilitated the connection of EVBs to a 2kV power supply, planned and laid out a 0.5m x 1m test setup housing thirteen power amplifiers, utilized ADS to design a coplanar microstrip low-pass filter, and became proficient with various electrical lab tools. In my second internship, I fabricated a cost-effective diplexer to meet specifications through EM simulations in Microwave Office and HFFS, figured out and documented how to use an old curve tracer to characterize ESD protection structures on RF ICs, and I conducted tests on RF ICs, contributing to the team's research and development efforts.
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>SEPTEMBER 2022 – PRESENT DAY, ELECTRICAL AND POWERTRAIN ENGINEER/ GROUP TECHNICAL LEAD, BRISTOL RACING
											</em><br>
											In my free time have worked in the Electrical and Powertrain team for Bristol Racing for just over a year. My work includes characterisation of the car's battery, designing a parameterised heatsink model and optimising its design through thermal simulations, implementation of the brake light detection circuit, and design of the driver’s control holder. I am also mill and lathe trained which I have used to make many of the metal parts required for the car. My work earned me the position of electrical technical co-lead on this year’s car.
									</p>
									<p>		
										<em>OCTOBER 2019 – MARCH 2020, ENGINEERING EDUCATION SCHEME</em><br>
										I was one of six students challenged to build a lifting device to remove up to 500Kg of radioactive waste from a particle accelerator. I contributed the core idea used in our final design. I also sized the geometry of the design by doing stress calculations. Finally, I oversaw the write-up. The project was extremely well received, earning me the Gold Industrial Cadet award.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>PROGRAMMING</em><br>
										I have written an application for the Willink school Maths department with ten different mathematical functionalities, a web scraping program I used to make £380 from trading in a video game, and various smaller projects, all in Python. These have taught me OOP, data analysis, GUI creation, data structures and algorithms. I have taught myself C++ by writing the software for my alarm clock, sous vied controller, and the battery monitoring circuits on the Bristol car.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>HOME PROJECTS</em><br>
										Projects built in my free time include a sunrise alarm clock, a sous vide machine, a 150g combat robot, and a monitor from an old iPad screen. Details and pictures of all of these can be found in my portfolio.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>2019 – 2021, OTHER JOBS</em><br>
										I made around £1000 selling sweets (2.5 years), I worked in the restaurant at IKEA (4 Months), I was a cleaner at The Willink School (8 Months), and I worked as a carer for a disabled 7-year-old who needed extra help to attend Beaver Scouts (8 Months).
									</p>
								<h2>QUALIFICATIONS AND SKILLS</h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>Bronze, Silver, and Gold Duke of Edinburgh awards</li>
											<li>The Willink School’s Science, Maths (twice), Computer Science and Physics end-of-year awards for best student</li>
											<li>12 years in the Scouting organisation, including leadership roles</li>
											<li>14 years in a football team, becoming team captain</li>
											<li>Winner of an IMechE First Year Undergraduate Scholarship</li>
											<li>Gold Industrial Cadet award</li>
