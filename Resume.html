								<h2>Experience</h2>
									<p>
										<em>JUNE 2023 – SEPTEMBER 2023, ELECTRICAL, CONTROL AND INSTRUMENTATION INTERN, FRAZER-NASH CONSULTANCY</em><br>
										I joined the Bristol EC&I North team for 13 weeks. My work involved PowerFactory modelling the grid impact of a fusion reactor, making electrical and thermal Simscape models, designing a high voltage electrical schematic, drawing single line diagrams for a power station, and writing supporting documentation for a nuclear power station.
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>JULY 2021/22 – SEPTEMBER 2021/22, RF ENGINEERING INTERN, SPIRIT SEMICONDUCTOR </em><br>
										I have completed two 9-week summer internships at Spirit Semiconductor, a start-up designing RF electronics for 5G. My work includes fabricating a diplexer through EM simulations in Microwave Office, ADS, and HFFS, designing a PCB for high voltage chip testing, figuring out and documenting how to use an old curve tracer to characterize ESD protection structures, and building a test setup for thirteen power amplifiers. I also became proficient with various electrical lab tools.
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>SEPTEMBER 2022 – PRESENT DAY, ELECTRICAL AND POWERTRAIN ENGINEER/ GROUP TECHNICAL LEAD, BRISTOL RACING</em><br>
											Bristol Racing make electric cars to compete in Greenpower racing events. My work includes battery characterisation, designing a heatsink model optimised through thermal simulations, implementation of the brake light detection circuit, design of the driver’s control holder, and fabrication of components using mills and lathes. I currently co-manage the eleven-person electrical and powertrain team.
									</p>
									<p>		
										<em>OCTOBER 2019 – MARCH 2020, ENGINEERING EDUCATION SCHEME</em><br>
										I was one of six students challenged to design a lifting device to remove up to 500 kg of radioactive waste from a particle accelerator. We built a scaled version of our design over two days at Bath University. I contributed the core idea used in our final design, did stress calculations on the design, and oversaw the write-up. The project was extremely well received, earning me the Gold Industrial Cadet award. 
										<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>HOME PROJECTS</em><br>
										Projects built in my free time include a sunrise alarm clock, a sous vide machine, two 150g combat robots, and a monitor from an old iPad screen.<br>
									</p>
								<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>
										<em>2021-2025, MENG MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL</em><br>
										Year two average: 78% (US 4.0 GPA ≈ UK 70%)<br>
										Highlights include 93% in Engineering Maths, 87% in Signals and Systems, 82% in Thermo-fluids, 77% in Dynamics and Control, and 75% in Electrical Energy Conversion and Supply. My course projects include designing, building, and testing a switched-mode power supply, using FEA for magnetic field modeling in a linear actuator, and using Simulink to design a boost converter and embedded control loops for a DC motor. Additionally, I've regularly used Fusion 360, Python, MATLAB, microcontrollers, and electronics lab skills.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>2021, A-LEVEL, THE WILLINK SCHOOL</em><br>
											All A*: A-levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer Science.<br>
