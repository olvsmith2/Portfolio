								<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>
										<em>2021-2025, MENG MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL</em><br>
										Year two average: 78%<br>
										Year one average: 72% <br>
										Highlights include 78% and 93% respectively in my first and second-year maths modules, 87% in year two Signals and Systems, 82% in year two Thermo-fluids, and 77% in year two Dynamics and Control. My course has also taught me Simulink/Simscape modelling, using FEA software, Fusion 360, and electronics lab skills.
<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>2021, A-LEVEL, THE WILLINK SCHOOL</em><br>
											All A*: A-levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer Science. <br>
									</p>
									<p>
											<em>2019 GCSE, THE WILLINK SCHOOL</em><br>
											All grade 9s: GCSEs in Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Geography, English Language, English Literature, French and Religious Education. <br>
									</p>
								<h2>Experience</h2>
									<p>
										<em>SUMMER 2023 ELECTRICAL, CONTROL AND INSTRUMENTATION INTERN, FRAZER-NASH CONSULTANCY</em><br>
										I spent 13 weeks working in the Bristol EC&I North team at Frazer-Nash. Over this time, I worked on a variety of projects which involved PowerFactory modelling to look at the grid impact of a nuclear fusion power station, researching and building electrical and thermal models using Simscape, designing the electrical schematic for a submarine test rig, drawing single line diagrams for a nuclear power station, writing supporting design documentation for a nuclear power station and evaluating different PLC options.
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>SEPTEMBER 2022 – PRESENT DAY, BRISTOL RACING</em><br>
										In my free time have worked in the Electrical and Powertrain team for Bristol Racing for just over a year. My work includes characterisation of the car's battery, designing a parameterised heatsink model and optimising its design through thermal simulations, implementation of the brake  light detection circuit, and design of the driver’s control holder. I am also mill and lathe trained which I have used to make many of the metal parts required for the car. My work earned me the position of electrical technical co-lead on this year’s car.
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>SUMMER 2021 AND 2022, RF ENGINEERING INTERN, SPIRIT SEMICONDUCTOR</em><br>
										I have completed two 9-week summer internships at Spirit Semiconductor, a start-up designing RF electronics for 5G. Over this time, I completed tasks including:
										<ul>
											<li>Designing a PCB which interfaced EVBs to a 2kV power supply.</li>
											<li>Making a diplexer to meet specifications by running EM simulations in microwave office, HFFS, and ADS. I tested different technologies to produce a design over 10 times cheaper than buying a premade diplexer.</li>       
											<li>Figuring out and documenting how to use an old curve tracer for characterising ESD protection structures on RF ICs.</li>
											<li>Using network analysers, signal generators, RF IC test setups, power tools, and soldering.</li>
											<li>Laying out and assembling a 0.5m x 1m test setup to split a signal between thirteen power amplifiers.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>		
										<em>OCTOBER 2019 – MARCH 2020, ENGINEERING EDUCATION SCHEME</em><br>
										I was one of six students challenged to build a lifting device to remove up to 500Kg of radioactive waste from a particle accelerator. I contributed the core idea used in our final design. I also sized the geometry of the design by doing stress calculations. Finally, I oversaw the write-up. The project was extremely well received, earning me the Gold Industrial Cadet award.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>PROGRAMMING</em><br>
										I have written an application for the Willink school Maths department with ten different mathematical functionalities, a web scraping program I used to make £380 from trading in a video game, and various smaller projects, all in Python. These have taught me OOP, data analysis, GUI creation, data structures and algorithms. I have taught myself C++ by writing the software for my alarm clock, sous vied controller, and the battery monitoring circuits on the Bristol car.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>HOME PROJECTS</em><br>
										Projects built in my free time include a sunrise alarm clock, a sous vide machine, a 150g combat robot, and a monitor from an old iPad screen. Details and pictures of all of these can be found in my portfolio.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>2019 – 2021, OTHER JOBS</em><br>
										I made around £1000 selling sweets over 2.5 years. I worked in the restaurant at IKEA from September 2019 to February 2020. I was a cleaner at The Willink School and I worked as a carer for a disabled 7-year-old who needed extra help to attend Beaver Scouts from October 2020 to June 2021.
									</p>
